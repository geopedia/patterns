<p>Summary 1:  An opaque door makes sense in a vast house or palace, where every room is large enough to be a world unto itself; but in a small building, with small rooms, the opaque door is only very rarely useful.</p>
<p>Summary 2: As often as possible build doors with glazing in them that the upper half at least, allows you to see through them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: What is needed is a kind of door which gives some sense of visual connection together with the possibility of acoustic isolation: a door which you can see through but can&#039;t hear through.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Glazed doors have been traditional in certain periods - they are beautiful, and enlarge the sense of connection and make the life in the house one, but still leave people the possibility of privacy they need.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A glazed door allows for a more graceful entrance into a room and for a more graceful reception by people in the room, because it allows both parties to get ready for each other.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Glaze the door with small panes of glass - SMALL PANES and make the doors more solid, by building them like WALL MEMBRANES(218).....</p>
