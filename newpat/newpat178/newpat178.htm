<p>Summary 1:  To the average individual in the city, it probably appears that the sewage system works beautifully - no muss, no fuss.</p>
<p>Summary 2: City dwellers who have had the experience of using a smelly outhouse would probably argue that our modern system of sewage disposal is a tremendous advance over earlier practices.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The average new homeowner today, living on a 50 x 150 foot lot in the city, has paid $1500 as his share of the collection system which takes sewage from his house to the sewage treatment plant.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We see then that the initial cost of today&#039;s sewage system is at least $2000 per house, often more.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Even if industrial wastes were not allowed into the sewage system, an additional distribution system would be needed to get the sludge back to the land.</p>
<p>Summary 6: We need a system that is less expensive; and we need a system that is an ecological benefit rather than an ecological drain..</p>
