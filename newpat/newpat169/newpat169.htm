<p>Summary 1:  On all land which slopes - in fields, in parks, in public gardens, even in the private gardens around a house - make a system of terraces and bunds which follow the contour lines.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make them by building low walls along the contour lines, and then backfilling them with earth to form the terraces.</p>
<p>Summary 3: There is no reason why the building itself should fit into the terraces - it can comfortably cross terrace lines.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The pattern of terracing makes as much sense on a small house lot as it does on the hills around a valley.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Once the terracing has been accomplished, the building can fit to it, and stretch across the lines of the terrace.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The new way is to make &quot;Terrace fields.&quot; The rocks are dynamited to get the needed building materials..</p>
