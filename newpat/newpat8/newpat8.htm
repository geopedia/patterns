<p>Summary 1: People can choose the kind of subculture they wish to live in, and can still experience many ways of life different from their own.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In a society where people have trouble finding their own selves, people will seem homogeneous, there will be less variety, and character will be weak.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Faced constantly with an unpredictable changing social world, people no longer generate the strength to draw on themselves; they draw more and more on the approval of others; they look to see whether people are smiling when they say something, and if they are, they go on saying it, and if not, they shut up.</p>
<p>Summary 4: &quot;Mass society not only creates a confusing situation in which people find it hard to find themselves - it also ...</p>
<p>Summary 5: creates chaos, in which people are confronted by impossible variety - the variety becomes a slush, which then concentrates merely on the most obvious.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Self-actualisation will only be able to happen when this fear is overcome; and that in turn, can only happen, when people are in familiar territory, among people of their own kind, whose habits and ways they know, and whom they trust.</p>
