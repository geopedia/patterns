<p>Summary 1:  Once you have decided more or less how people will move around within the BUILDING COMPLEX, and roughly how high the buildings will be - NUMIBER OF STORIES - it is time to try and find the natural heart or center of the building complex, to help complete its CIRCULATION REALMS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: For any collection of buildings, decide which building in the group houses the most essential function - which building is the soul of the group, as a human institution.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Even if the building complex is so dense that it is a single building, build the main part of it higher and more prominent than the rest, so that the eye goes immediately to the part which is the most important.</p>
<p>Summary 4: From the point of view of the group of users - the workers or the inhabitants - the sense of community and connection is heightened when one building or a part of one building is singled out and treated as a main building, common to all, the heart of the institution.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Build all the main paths tangent to the main building, in arcades or glazed corridors, with a direct view into its main functions - COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the roof cascade down from the high roof over the main building to lower roofs over the smaller build ings - CASCADE OF ROOFS..</p>
