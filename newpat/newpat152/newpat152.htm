<p>Summary 1:  Within the overall arrangement of group space and individual working space provided by INTIMACY GRADIENT, FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE, and SMALL WORK GROUPS, this pattern shapes the individual rooms and offices.</p>
<p>Summary 2: What is the right balance between privacy and connection in office work?.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The totally private office has a devastating effect on the flow of human relationships within a work group, and entrenches the ugly quality of office hierarchies.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Everyone who has experienced office work reports some version of this problem.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The workings of the group became formalized; easy-going communication vanished; the entire atmosphere changed from a setting which sustained our growth as a group to an office bureaucracy, where people made appointments with each other, left notes in special boxes, and nervously knocked on each other&#039;s doors.</p>
<p>Summary 6: As we thought it out, it seemed that almost every place where we had found ourselves working well together had these characteristics: no office was entirely private; most offices were for more than one person; but even when an office was only for one, it had a kind of simple common area at its front and everyone felt free to drop in and stay for a moment..</p>
