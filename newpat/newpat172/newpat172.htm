<p>Summary 1:  In short, we must decide what kind of garden to have, what kind of plants to grow, what style of gardening is compatible with both artifice and nature.</p>
<p>Summary 2: These gardens have none of the quality which brings a garden to life - the quality of a wilderness, tamed, still wild, but cultivated enough to be in harmony with the buildings which surround it and the people who move in it.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In these gardens things are arranged so that the natural processes which come into being will maintain the condition of the garden and not degrade it.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In a sensible and natural garden, the garden is arranged so that this process enhances the garden and does not threaten it.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In the garden growing wild the plants are chosen, and the boundaries placed, in such a way that the growth of things regulates itself.</p>
<p>Summary 6: A garden growing wild is healthier, more capable of stable growth, than the more clipped and artificial garden..</p>
