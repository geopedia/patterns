<p>Summary 1:  People cannot work effectively if their workspace is too enclosed or too exposed.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If there are other people working nearby, arrange the enclosure so that the person has a sense of connection to two or three others; but never put more than eight workspaces within view or earshot of one another.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In the interview, we first asked each person to think of the very best workspace he had ever worked in and the very worst; and then asked him to make a sketch plan of both spaces.</p>
<p>Summary 4: You feel more comfortable in a workspace if there is a wall behind you.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Each workspace should be 50 to 75 per cent enclosed by walls or windows.</p>
<p>Summary 6: For the view, give each workspace a window to the outside - WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE; surround the space with thick walls which contain shelves and storage space - HALF-OPEN WALL, THICK WALLS, OPEN SHELVES, WAIST-HIGH SHELF; arrange a pool of incandescent light over the work table to set it off - POOLS OF LIGHT; and try to make a sitting place, next to the workspace, so that the pulse of work, and talk can happen easily throughout the day - SITTING CIRCLE..</p>
