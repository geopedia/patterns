<p><i>Summaries of content, keywords and links generated by algorithms. Thank you <a href="http://smmry.com/" target="_blank">smmry.com</a>:</i></p>
<p>Summary 1:  THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS describes the generosity of light and movement in the way that rooms connect to one another and recommends against the use of passages.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When there has to be a passage in an office or a house and when it is too small to be a BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, it must be treated very specially, as if it were itself a room.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The ugly long repetitive corridors of the machine age have so far infected the word &quot;Corridor&quot; that it is hard to imagine that a corridor could ever be a place of beauty, a moment in your passage from room to room, which means as much as all the moments you spend in the rooms themselves.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The second issue is the relation of the passage to the rooms which open off it.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Put in windows, bookshelves, and furnishings to make them as much like actual rooms as possible, with alcoves, seats along the edge - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM, ALCOVES, WINDOW PLACE, THICK WALLS, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS; open up the long side into the garden or out onto balconies - OUTDOOR ROOM, GALLERY SURROUND, LOW SILL.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make interior windows between the passage and the rooms which open off it - INTERIOR WINDOWS, SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS..</p>
