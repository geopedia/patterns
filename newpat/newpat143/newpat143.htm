<p>Summary 1:  Place the children&#039;s beds in alcoves or small alcove-like rooms, around a common playspace.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In between these two extremes, there is a kind of configuration in which children have their own, small, private spaces, not as large as rooms, clustered around a common playspace.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In short, for young children, especially in that age when feelings of possession and control are developing, the one room with many beds is just too difficult.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In spite of this potentially reasonable cultural relativism, it seems to us that although adults do need their own rooms, the isolation of a private room for a small child may perhaps be fundamentally incompatible with healthy psycho-social development; and might even do organic damage.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Children need some privacy, some way of retreating from endless squabbles about territory, some way of having a miniature version of the adult&#039;s &quot;Room of his own.&quot; Yet at the same time, they also need extensive, almost animal, contact with others - their talk, their care, their touch, their sound, their smell.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use the location of dressing areas and closets to help shape the bed cluster and the individual alcoves - DRESSING ROOM, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS ; include some tiny nooks and crannies - CHILD CAVESGive the entire space LIGHT ON TWO SIDES..</p>
