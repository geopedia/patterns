<p>Summary 1:  Outdoors there are various low walls at sitting height - SITTING WALL; terraced gardens, if the garden has a natural slope in it - TERRACED SLOPE; and paths and steps and crinkled building edges - PATHS AND GOALS, STAIR SEATS, BUILDING EDGE, GARDEN WALLThese are the best spots for flowers, and flowers help to make them beautiful.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Flowers are beautiful along the edges of paths, buildings, outdoor rooms - but it is just in these places that they need the most protection from traffic.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Soften the edges of buildings, paths, and outdoor areas with flowers.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Raise the flower beds so that people can touch the flowers, bend to smell them, and sit by them.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Build the flower beds with solid edges, so that people can sit on them, among the flowers too.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make quite certain that the flowers are placed in positions where people really can enjoy them - and not simply as ornament: outside favorite windows, along traveled paths, near entrances and round doorways, by outdoor seats..</p>
