<p>Summary 1:  In most places, we get heat in all three ways from our environment: conducted heat from the solids we touch, convected heat in the air around us, and radiated heat from those sources of radiation in our line of sight.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Of the three, conducted heat is trivial, since any surface hot enough to conduct heat to us directly is too hot for comfort.</p>
<p>Summary 3: As far as the other two are concerned - convected heat and radiant heat - we may ask whether there is any biological difference in their effects on human beings.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Hot air systems, and buried pipes, and the so-called hot water &quot;Radiators&quot; do transmit some of their heat to us by means of radiation, but most of the heat we get from them comes from convection.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The conditions in which people feel most comfortable require a subtle balance of convected heat and radiant heat.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Radiant panels, with individual room control, and infrared heaters hung from walls and ceilings, are possible high technology sources of radiant heat..</p>
