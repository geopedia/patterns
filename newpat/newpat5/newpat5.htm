<p>Summary 1:  According to the pattern CITY COUNTRY FINGERS, there is a rather sharp division between city land and rural land.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In the zone where city and country meet, place country roads at least a mile apart, so that they enclose squares of countryside and farmland at least one square mile in area.</p>
<p>Summary 3: To have quick access to the city, you must live on a road, within a few minutes&#039; drive from city centers, and with a bus line outside your door.</p>
<p>Summary 4: A &quot;Lace of country streets&quot; contains square miles of open countryside, fast roads from the city at the edge of these square miles, houses clustered along the roads, and footpaths stretching out from the city, crisscrossing the countryside.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The countryside can be made accessible to city people by means of footpaths and trails running from the edge of the city and from the country roads into the countryside, across the squares of open land.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make each square mile of country side, both farm and park, open to the public - THE COUNTRYSIDE; arrange the half acre lots to form clusters of houses and neighborhoods, even when they are rather spread out - IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOODS, HOUSE CLUSTER.....</p>
