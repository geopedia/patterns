<p>Summary 1:  We continue to fill out the BUILDING EDGE.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If people cannot walk out from the building onto balconies and terraces which look toward the outdoor space around the building, then neither they themselves nor the people outside have any medium which helps them feel the building and the larger public world are intertwined.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We have discussed the importance of the building edge in two other patterns: BUILDING EDGE itself, and ARCADES.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We believe, simply, that every building needs at least one place, and preferably a whole range of places, where people can be still within the building, but in touch with the people and the scene outside.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We need places along the upper stories of the building&#039;s edge where we can live comfortably, for hours, in touch with the street - playing cards, bringing work out on the terrace on a hot day, eating, scrambling with children or setting up an electric train, drying and folding the wash, sculpting with clay, paying the bills.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Keep them real; find the places along the building edge that offer a direct and useful connection with the life indoors - the space outside the stair landing, the space to one side of the bedroom alcove, and so on..</p>
