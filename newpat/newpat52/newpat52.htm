<p>Summary 1:  Except where traffic densities are very high or very low, lay out pedestrian paths at right angles to roads, not along them, so that the paths gradually begin to form a second network, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to it.</p>
<p>Summary 2: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to find an arrangement of pedestrian paths and roads, so that the two are separate, but meet frequently, with the points where they meet recognized as focal points.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Between the roads there are pedestrian paths running at right angles to the roads, with buildings opening off the pedestrian paths.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Most typically of all, there is an existing road system: and the paths can be put in one by one, piecemeal, at right angles to the existing roads.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The edge away from the road is safe - the edge near the road is the place where the activities happen.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Where paths have to run along major roads - as they do occasionally - build them 18 inches higher than the road, on one side of the road only, and twice the usual width-RAISED WALK; on GREEN STREETS the paths can be in the road since there is nothing but grass and paving stones there; but even then, occasional narrow paths at right angles to the green streets are very beautiful..</p>
