<p>Summary 1:  All the areas where people live and work - especially the WORK COMMUNITIES and the areas looked after by the preventive programs of the HEALTH CENTER - need to be completed by provisions for sports and exercise.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In agricultural society, people use their bodies every day in many different ways.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In urban society, most people use their minds, but not their bodies; or they use their bodies only in a routine way.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In th le societies, people work both with their hands and with their minds.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We imagine these facilities as nonprofit centers supported by the people who use them, perhaps coordinated with a program of health prevention like the swimming and dancing at the Pioneer Health Center in Peckham - see HEALTH CENTER.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat the sports places as a special class of recognizable simple buildings, which are open, easy to get into, with changing rooms and showers - BUILDING COMPLEX, BATHING ROOM; combine them with community swimming pools, where they exist - STILL WATER ; keep them open to people passing - BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, OPENING TO THE STREET,and provide places where people can stop and watch - SEAT SPOTS, SITTING WALL.....</p>
