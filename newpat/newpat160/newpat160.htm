<p>Summary 1:  A building is most often thought of as something which turns inward - toward its rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: People do not often think of a building as something which must also be oriented toward the outside.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Crenelate the edge of buildings with places that invite people to stop.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Unless the building is oriented toward the outside, which surrounds it, as carefully and positively as toward its inside, the space around the building will be useless and blank - with the direct effect, in the long run, that the building will be socially isolated, because you have to cross a no-man&#039;s land to get to it.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The machine-like building is cut off from its surroundings, isolated, an island.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The building with a lively building edge, is connected, part of the social fabric, part of the town, part of the lives of all the people who live and move around it..</p>
