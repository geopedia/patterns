<p>Summary 1:  Keep the stair roofed or unroofed, according to climate, but at all events leave the stair open at ground level, without a door, so that the stair is functionally a continuation of the street.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The simple fact of the matter is that an apartment on the second floor of a building is wonderful when it has a direct stair to the street, and much less wonderful when it is merely one of several apartments served by an internal stair.</p>
<p>Summary 3: By contrast, in industrialized, authoritarian societies most stairs are indoor stairs.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In effect we are saying that a centralized entrance, which funnels everyone in a building through it, has in its nature the trappings of control; while the pattern of many open stairs, leading off the public streets, direct to private doors, has in its nature the fact of independence, free comings and goings.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Where the stair comes down to the ground, make an entrance which helps to repair the family of entrances that exist already on the street - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES; make the landings and the top of the stair, where it reaches the roof, into gardens where things can grow and where people can sit in the sun - ROOF GARDEN, SUNNY PLACE.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Remember STAIR SEATS, and build the stair according to STAIRCASE VOLUME.....</p>
