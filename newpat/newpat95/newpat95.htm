<p>Summary 1: A building cannot be a human building unless it is a complex of still smaller buildings or smaller parts which manifest its own internal social facts.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Two kinds of public service buildings were studied - old, three story buildings and huge modern office buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The buildings impress themselves upon us as things: objects, commodities; they make us forget the people inside, as people; yet when we use these buildings we complain vaguely about the &quot;General atmosphere&quot;.</p>
<p>Summary 4: A gothic cathedral - though an immense building - is an example of a building complex.</p>
<p>Summary 5: For a complex of buildings at high density, the easiest way of all, of making its human parts identifiable, is to build it up from narrow fronted buildings, each with its own internal stair.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Arrange the buildings in the complex to form realms of movement - CIRCULATION REALMS ; build one building from the collection as a main building - the natural center of the site MAIN BUILDING; place individual buildings where the land is least beautiful, least healthy - SITE REPAIR ; and put them to the north of their respective open space to keep the gardens sunny - SOUTH-FACING OUTDOORS(105); subdivide them further, into narrow wings, no more than 25 or 30 feet across WINGS OF LIGHT..</p>
