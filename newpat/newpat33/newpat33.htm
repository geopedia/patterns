<p>Summary 1:  Most of the city&#039;s activities close down at night; those which stay open won&#039;t do much for the night life of the city unless they are together.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Knit together shops, amusements, and services which are open at night, along with hotels, bars, and all-night diners to form centers of night life: well-lit, safe, and lively places that increase the intensity of pedestrian activity at night by drawing all the people who are out at night to the same few spots in the town.</p>
<p>Summary 3: People enjoy going out at night; a night on the town is something special.</p>
<p>Summary 4: A paper by Shlomo Angel, &quot;The Ecology of Night Life&quot;, shows the highest number of street crimes occurring in those areas where night spots are scattered.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Centralizing these places robs the city as a whole of several centers of night life.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat the physical layout of the night life area exactly like any other ACTIVITY NODE, except that all of its establishments are open at night..</p>
