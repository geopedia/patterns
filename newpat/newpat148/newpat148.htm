<p>Summary 1:  Arrange these work groups so that each person is in at least partial view of the other members of his own group; and arrange several groups in such a way that they share a common entrance, food, office equipment, drinking fountains, bathrooms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The small group achieves a nice balance between the one extreme in which there are so many people, that there is no opportunity for an intimate social structure to develop, and the other extreme in which there arc so few, that the possibility of social groups does not occur at all.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Analysis of the results also showed that &quot;The people who work in small office areas are more opposed to large office areas than those who actually work in them.&quot; Apparently, once people have had the experience of working in small groups, they find it very uncomfortable to imagine going back to the larger office settings.</p>
<p>Summary 4: How should these small groups be related to each other? Brian Wells points out that while small offices support an intimate atmosphere, they do not support communications between groups.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Lay the workgroups out with respect to each other so that the distances between groups is within the constraints of OFFICE CONNECTIONS, and give each group office space which leaves room to expand and to contract - FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE; provide a common area, either for the group itself or for several groups together or both - COMMON AREA AT THE HEART.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat each small work group, in every kind of industry and office, as a place of learning - MASTER AND APPRENTICES..</p>
