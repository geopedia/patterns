<p>Summary 1:  If you have followed sheltering roof, your roof has living space within it: and it must therefore have windows in it, to bring light into the roof.</p>
<p>Summary 2: We know from our discussion of SHELTERING ROOF that the top story of the building should be right inside the roof, surrounded by it.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Wherever you have windows in the roof, make dormer windows which are high enough to stand in, and frame them like any other alcoves in the building.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Obviously, if there is habitable space inside the roof, it must have some kind of windows; skylights are not satisfactory as windows - except in studios or workshops - because they do not create a connection between the inside and the outside world - WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Aside from bringing in light and air and the connection to the outside, they relieve the low ceilings along the edge of the roofs and create alcoves and window places.</p>
<p>Summary 6: How should the dormers be constructed? Within the roof vault we have described, the basket which forms the vault can simply be continued to form the roof of the dormer, over a frame of columns and perimeter beams which form the opening..</p>
