<p>Summary 1:  Any part of a town - large or small - which is to be identified by its inhabitants as a precinct of some kind, will be reinforced, helped in its distinctness, marked, and made more vivid, if the paths which enter it are marked by gateways where they cross the boundary.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Mark every boundary in the city which has important human meaning - the boundary of a building cluster, a neighborhood, a precinct - by great gateways where the major entering paths cross the boundary.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A boundary around an important precinct, whether a neighborhood, a building complex, or some other area, is most critical at those points where paths cross the boundary.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If the point where the path crosses the boundary is invisible, then to all intents and purposes the boundary is not there.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Essentially, the crossing of a boundary by a path can only be marked by a gateway.</p>
<p>Summary 6: All of these have the same function: they mark the point where a path crosses a boundary and help maintain the boundary..</p>
