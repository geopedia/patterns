<p>Summary 1:  Within a town whose public transportation is based on MINIBUSES, genuinely able to serve people, almost door to door, for a low price, and very fast, there need to be bus stops within a few hundred feet of every house and workplace.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Bus stops must be easy to recognize, and pleasant, with enough activity around them to make people comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Build bus stops so that they form tiny centers of public life.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Bus stops are often dreary because they are set down independently, with very little thought given to the experience of waiting there, to the relationship between the bus stop and its surroundings.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The possibilities for each bus stop to become part of such a web are different - in some cases it will be right to make a system that will draw people into a private reverie - an old tree; another time one that will do the opposite - give shape to the social possibilities - a coffee stand, a canvas roof, a decent place to sit for people who are not waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make a full gateway to the neighborhood next to the bus stop, or place the bus stop where the best gateway is already - MAIN GATEWAY; treat the physical arrangement according to the patterns for PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM, PATH SHAPE, and A PLACE TO WAIT; provide a FOOD STAND: place the seats according to sun, wind protection, and view - SEAT SPOTS .....</p>
