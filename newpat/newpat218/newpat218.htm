<p>Summary 1:  According to EFFICIENT STRUCTURE and FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION, the wall is a compressive loadbearing membrane, &quot;Stretched&quot; between adjacent columns and continuous with them, the columns themselves placed at frequent intervals to act as stiffeners.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build the wall as a membrane which connects the columns and door frames and windows frames and is, at least in part, continuous with them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: To build the wall, first put up an inner and an outer membrane, which can function as a finished surface; then pour the fill into the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When walls are working like this, they are essentially structural membranes: they are continuous in two dimensions; together with stiffeners and columns they resist loads in compression; and they create a continuous rigid connection between columns, beams, and floors, both above and below, to help resist shear and bending.</p>
<p>Summary 5: By contrast, curtain walls and walls which are essentially &quot;Infill,&quot; do not act as membranes.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The wall is built by fixing nailing blocks to the sides of columns..</p>
