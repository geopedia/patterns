<p>Summary 1:  A house feels isolated from the nature around it, unless its floors are interleaved directly with the earth that is around the house.</p>
<p>Summary 2: We shall understand this best by contrasting those houses which are sharply separated from the earth with those in which there is a continuity between the two.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Perhaps the likeliest of all the explanations we are able to imagine is one which connects the earth boundness and rootedness of a man or a woman to their physical connection to the earth.</p>
<p>Summary 4: These surfaces are made of intermediate materials more natural than the floors inside the house - and more man-made than earth and clay and grass.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Brick terraces, tiles, and beaten earth tied into the foundations of the house all help make this connection; and, if possible, each house should have a reasonable amount of them, pushing out into the land around the house and opening up the outdoors to the inside.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use the connection to the earth to form the ground for outdoor rooms, and entrances, and terraces - ENTRANCE ROOM, PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, OUTDOOR ROOM, TERRACED SLOPE; prepare to tie the terraces continuously into the wall which forms the edge of the ground floor slab, to make the very structure of the building feel connected to the earth - GROUND FLOOR SLAB; and where you come to form the terrace surfaces, use things like hand-made bricks and softbaked crumbling biscuit-fired tile - SOFT TILE AND BRICK; and further out, along the paths a little distance from the house, leave cracks between the tiles to let the grass and flowers grow between them - PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES.....</p>
