<p>Summary 1:  What seems to be required is a cottage which, in its organization and location, strikes the balance between a new independence and new ties to the family.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The cottage might even be an entirely detached structure in the garden, but in this case, a very strong connection to the main house is essential: perhaps a short covered path from the cottage into the main kitchen.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Is the idea of the teenage cottage acceptable to parents? Silverstein interviewed 12 mothers living in Foster City, a suburb of San Francisco, and asked them whether they would like a teenage cottage in their family.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The cottage would break up the family; it isolates the teenager.</p>
<p>Summary 5: To meet the second objection, attach the cottage to the house, but with its own entrance; attach the cottage to the house via a short hall or vestibule or keep the cottage to the back of the lot, behind the house.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Arrange the cottage to contain a SITTING CIRCLE and a BED ALCOVE but not a private bath and kitchen - sharing these is essential: it allows the boy or girl to keep enough connection with the family..</p>
