<p>Summary 1:  The places specially devoted to children&#039;s play - ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND, CHILDREN&#039;S HOME, CHILDREN&#039;S REALM - and THICK WALLS-can be embellished with a special detail.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Wherever children play, around the house, in the neighborhood, in schools, make small &quot;Caves&quot; for them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Tuck these caves away in natural left over spaces, under stairs, under kitchen counters.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In the course of their play, young children seek out cave-like spaces to get into and under-old crates, under tables, in tents, etc.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When children are playing in such a &quot;Cave&quot; - each child takes up about 5 square feet; furthermore, children like to do this in groups, so the caves should be large enough to accommodate this: these sorts of groups range in size from three to five - so is to 25 square feet, plus about 15 square feet for games and circulation, gives a rough maximum size for caves.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the doors very tiny to match the caves - an extreme version of LOW DOORWAY.....</p>
