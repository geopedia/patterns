<p>Summary 1:  In its geometry, conceive it as a three-dimensional system of individually vaulted spaces, most of them roughly rectangular; with thin load-bearing walls, each stiffened by columns at intervals along its length, thickened where walls meet walls and where walls meet vaults and stiffened around the openings.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Right angles tend to create discontinuities: forces can be distributed throughout the building only if there are diagonal fillets wherever walls meet ceilings, walls meet walls, and columns meet beams.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The wall provides it naturally; and the continuity of the walls, floor, and ceiling can only be created by the action of a wall that ties them together.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Connections between walls and floors, and between walls and walls, must all be thickened by extra material that forms a fillet along the seam.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We know from THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE that we cannot avoid rough right angles where walls meet walls; and of course, there must be rough right angles where walls meet floors.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The layout of the stiffeners which make the walls is given in FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION; the layout of the thickening where walls meet walls is given by COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS; the thickening where walls meet vaults is given by PERIMETER BEAMS; the construction of the columns and the walls is given by BOX COLUMNS and WALL MEMBRANES; the thickening of doors and window frames is given by FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES; and the non- right-angled connection between columns and beams by COLUMN CONNECTION.....</p>
