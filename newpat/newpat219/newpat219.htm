<p>Summary 1:  We seek a ceiling vault shape which will support a live load on the floor above, form the ceiling of the room below, and generate as little bending and tension as possible so that compressive materials can be relied on.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Use a type of construction which makes it possible to fit the vault to any shaped room after the walls and columns are in position: on no account use a prefabricated vault.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The vault shape is governed by two constraints: the ceiling cannot be lower than about 6 feet at the edge of the room, except in occasional attic rooms; and the ceiling in the middle of the room should vary with the room size (8 to 12 feet for large rooms, 7 to 9 feet for middle sized rooms, and 6 to 7 feet for the very smallest alcoves and corners - see CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY.</p>
<p>Summary 4: All of these are well within the capacity of the vault, and besides, shrinkage reinforcement in the vault will make it even stronger.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The analysis shows that even though the vault is an impure form, its structural behavior is still close enough to that of a pure vault to work essentially as a compression structure.</p>
<p>Summary 6: When the main vault is finished, mark the positions of all those columns which will be placed on the floor above it - FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION - Whenever there are columns which are more than 2 feet away from the perimeter beam, strengthen the vault with ribs and extra reinforcing to withstand the vertical forces..</p>
