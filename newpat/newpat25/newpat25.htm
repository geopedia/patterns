<p>Summary 1:  The very movement of the people toward the water can also destroy the water.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Allow dense settlements to come right down to the water only at infrequent intervals along the water&#039;s edge.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Either roads, freeways, and industries destroy the water&#039;s edge and make it so dirty or so treacherous that it is virtually inaccessible; or when the water&#039;s edge is preserved, it falls into private hands.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The problem can be solved only if it is understood that people will build places near the water because it is entirely natural; but that the land immediately along the water&#039;s edge must be preserved for common use.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The width of the belt of land along the water may vary with the type of water, the density of development along it, and the ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In any case, do not build roads along the water within one mile of the water; instead, make all the approach roads at right angles to the edge, and very far apart -PARALLEL ROADS..</p>
