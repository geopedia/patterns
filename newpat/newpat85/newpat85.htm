<p>Summary 1:  Any public school can provide the teacher and the bus.</p>
<p>Summary 2: I would like to make clear that in constrasting our own procedures with those of the public schools, I am not trying to criticize the teachers who find themselves embattled in the institutional setting and overburdened to the point of madness....</p>
<p>Summary 3: My point is precisely that the intimacy and small scale of our school should be imitated widely, since these things alone make possible the human contact capable of curing the diseases we have been naming with such frequency for the last ten years.</p>
<p>Summary 4: By eliminating the expenses of the centralized school, Dennison found he was able to reduce the student-teacher ratio by a factor of three! Public school teachers, with their 30 to 1 ratios, will be aware that we have entered the realm of sheer luxury.</p>
<p>Summary 5: By eliminating the building and the salaries of all those persons who do not directly work with the children, the student/teacher ratio can be reduced from something like 35/1 to 10/1.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In this one stroke many of the most pressing public school problems can be eliminated at no extra cost to the school or school district..</p>
