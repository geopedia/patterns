<p>Summary 1:  Smooth hard flat industrialized walls make it impossible for people to express their own identity, because most of the identity of a dwelling lies in or near its surfaces - in the 3 or 4 feet near the walls.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The house will become personal only if the walls are so constructed that each new family can leave its mark on them - they must, in other words, invite incremental fine adjustments, so that the variety of the inhabitants who live in it rubs off on them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: To contain shelves, cabinets, displays, special lights, special surfaces, deep window reveals, individual niches, built in seats and nooks, the walls must be at least a foot deep; perhaps even three or four feet deep.</p>
<p>Summary 4: After a year or two of occupancy, each dwelling will begin to show its own characteristic pattern of niches, bay windows, breakfast nooks, seats built into the walls, shelves, closets, lighting arrangements, sunken parts of the floor, raised parts of the ceiling.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Each house will have a memory; the characteristics and personalities of different human individuals can be written in the thickness of the walls; the houses will become progressively more and more differentiated as they grow older, and the process of personal adaptation - both by choice and by piecemeal modification - has room to breathe.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Feet, build the thickness and the volume of the walls according to the process described in THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS; where it is less, a foot or 18 inches, build it from open shelves stretched between deep vertical columns - OPEN SHELVES, COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS..</p>
