<p>Summary 1:  No people who turn their backs on death can be alive.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Huge cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, or in places no one ever visits, impersonal funeral rites, taboos which hide the fact of death from children, all conspire to keep the fact of death away from us, the living.</p>
<p>Summary 3: There are thousands of variations, but the point is always to give the community of friends left alive the chance to reconcile themselves to the facts of death: the emptiness, the loss; their own transience.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In the big industrial cities, during the past 100 years, the ceremonies of death and their functional power for the living have been completely undermined.</p>
<p>Summary 5: What were once beautifully simple forms of mourning have been replaced by grotesque cemeteries, plastic flowers, everything but the reality of death.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Above all, the small graveyards which once put people into daily contact with the fact of death, have vanished - replaced by massive cemeteries, far away from people&#039;s daily business..</p>
