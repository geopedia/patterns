<p>Summary 1:  Streets should be for staying in, and not just for moving through, the way they are today.</p>
<p>Summary 2: For centuries, the street provided city dwellers with usable public space right outside their houses.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Now, in a number of subtle ways, the modern city has made streets which are for &quot;Going through,&quot; not for &quot;Staying in.&quot; This is reinforced by regulations which make it a crime to loiter, by the greater attractions inside the side itself, and by streets which are so unattractive to stay in, that they almost force people into their houses.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The street shape is created by gradually stepping back the houses, in plan.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The result is a street with a positive, somewhat elliptical shape.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Above all, to create the shape of the path, move the building fronts into the right positions, and on no acount allow a set-back between the building and the path - BUILDING FRONTS; decide on the appropriate area for the &quot;Bulge&quot; by using the arithmetic of PEDESTRIAN DENSITY; then form the details of the bulge with ARCADES, ACTIVITY POCKETS and STAIR SEATS; perhaps even with a PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM ; and give as much life as you can to the path all along its length with windows - STREET WINDOWS.....</p>
