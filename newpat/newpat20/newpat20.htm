<p>Summary 1:  Establish a system of small taxi-like buses, carrying up to six people each, radio-controlled, on call by telephone, able to provide point-to-point service according to the passengers&#039; needs, and supplemented by a computer system which guarantees minimum detours, and minimum waiting times.</p>
<p>Summary 2: While conventional fixed route public transport systems are experiencing a dangerous spiral of lower levels of service, fewer passengers, and increased public subsidies, over 30 working dial-a-bus systems are presently in successful operation throughout the world.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A dial-a-bus system in Regina, Saskatchewan, is the only part of the Regina Transit System which supports itself.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Among the physically disabled about 5.7 million are potential riders of public transportation if the system could take them door-to-door.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Second, quite apart from these special needs, the fact is that a web of public transportation, with large buses, boats, and trains, will not work anyway, without a mini-bus system.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The mini-bus system is essential for the purpose of providing feeder service in the larger web of public transportation..</p>
