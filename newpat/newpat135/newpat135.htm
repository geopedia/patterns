<p>Summary 1:  Create alternating areas of light and dark throughout the building, in such a way that people naturally walk toward the light, whenever they are going to important places: seats, entrances, stairs, passages, places of special beauty, and make other areas darker, to increase the contrast.</p>
<p>Summary 2: People are by nature phototropic - they move toward light, and, when stationary, they orient themselves toward the light.</p>
<p>Summary 3: As a result the much loved and much used places in buildings, where the most things happen, are places like window seats, verandas, fireside corners, trellised arbors; all of them defined by nonuniformities in light, and all of them allowing the people who are in them to orient themselves toward the light.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Since there is good reason to believe that people need a rich variety of settings in their lives, and since settings are defined by &quot;Places,&quot; which in turn seem often to be defined by light, and since light places can only be defined by contrast with darker ones, this suggests that the interior parts of buildings where people spend much time should contain a great deal of alternating light and dark.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If the places wheren the light falls are not the places you are meant to go toward, or if the light is uniform, the environment is giving information which contradicts its own meaning.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Where the light to walk toward is natural light, build seats and alcoves in those windows which attract the movement - WINDOW PLACE..</p>
