<p>Summary 3: Obviously, a rich mix of subcultures will not be possible if each subculture is being inhibited by pressure from its neighbors.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If we look around a metropolitan area, and pinpoint the strongly differentiated subcultures, those with character, we shall always find that they are near boundaries and hardly ever close to other communities.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In just the same way, differentiation between subcultures in a city will be able to take place most easily when the flow of those elements which account for cultural variety - values, style, information, and so on - is at least partially restricted between neighboring subcultures.</p>
