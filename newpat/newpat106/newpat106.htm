<p>Summary 1:  There are two fundamentally different kinds of outdoor space: negative space and positive space.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If you look at the plan of an environment where outdoor spaces are negative, you see the buildings as figure, and the outdoor space as ground.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If you look at the plan of an environment where outdoor spaces are positive, you may see the buildings as figure, and outdoor spaces as ground - and,you may also see the outdoor spaces as figure against the ground of the buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In mathematics, a space is convex when a line joining any two points inside the space itself lies totally inside the space.</p>
<p>Summary 5: People feel comfortable in spaces which are &quot;Positive&quot; and use these spaces; people feel relatively uncomfortable in spaces which are &quot;Negative&quot; and such spaces tend to remain unused.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use open trellised walks, walls, and trees to close off spaces which are too exposed - TREE PLACES, CARDEN WALL, TRELLISED WALK; but make sure that every space is always open to some larger space, so that it is not too enclosed - HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE..</p>
