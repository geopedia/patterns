<p>Summary 1:  The explicit recognition of the life cycle as the basis for every individual life will do a great deal to help people&#039;s health in the community - LIFE CYCLE; this pattern describes the more specific institutions which help people to care for themselves and their health.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Gradually develop a network of small health centers, perhaps one per community of 7000, across the city; each equippect to treat everyday disease both mental and physical, in children and adults - but organized essentially around a functional emphasis on those recreational and educational activities which help keep people in good health, like swimming anc dancmg.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A system of health care which is actually capable of keeping people healthy, in both mind and body, must put its emphasis on health, not sickness.</p>
<p>Summary 4: There is converging evidence and speculation in the health care literature that health centers with these characteristics, organized according to the philosophy of health maintenance, are critical.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The conception of health which is created by this multi-phasic program is still &quot;Freedom from sickness.&quot; It is essentially negative There is no effort made toward the positive creation and maintenance of actual, blooming, health.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The only health center we know which actually devoted itself to health instead of sickness was the famous Peckham Health Center in England..</p>
