<p>Summary 1:  In any office, or workshop, or public service, or station, or clinic, where people have to wait - INTERCHANGE, HEALTH CENTER, SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE, OFFICE CONNECTIONS, it is essential to provide a special place for waiting, and doubly essential that this place not have the sordid, enclosed, time-slowed character of ordinary waiting rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In places where people end up waiting, create a situation which makes the waiting positive.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Fuse the waiting with some other activity - newspaper, coffee, pool tables, horseshoes; something which draws people in who are not simply waiting.</p>
<p>Summary 4: On the one hand, whatever people are waiting for - the doctor, an airplane, a business appointment - has built in uncertainties, which make it inevitable that they must spend a long time hanging around, waiting, doing nothing.</p>
<p>Summary 5: How can the people who are waiting, spend their time wholeheartedly - live the hours or minutes while they wait, as fully as the other hours of their day - and yet still be on hand, whenever the event or the person they are waiting for is ready?.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The right atmosphere will come naturally if the waiting area provides some places that are quiet, protected, and do not draw out the anxiety of the wait..</p>
