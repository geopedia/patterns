<p>Summary 1:  Given the layout of rooms, it is now necessary to decide exactly where to put the built-in cupboards and closets.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Use them, especially, to help form the enclosure around a workspace - WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE, around a dressing space - DRESSING ROOM, and around the doors of rather private rooms so that the doorway itself gets some depth - CORNER DOOR.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Then place the closets themselves on those interior walls which lie between two rooms and between rooms and passages where you need acoustic insulation.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Place them so as to create transition spaces for the doors into the rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When storage is placed in the interior walls of a room, around the doorway, the resulting thickness will make the transitions between rooms and corridors more distinct.</p>
<p>Summary 6: For the person entering such a room, the thickness of the wall creates a subtle &quot;Entry&quot; space, which makes the room more private..</p>
