<p>Summary 1:  Informal experiments in our communities have led us to believe that people agree, to an astonishing extent, about the sites which do embody people&#039;s relation to the land and to the past.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In any geographic area large or small ask a large number of people which sites and which places make them feel the most contact with the area; which sites stand most for the important values of the past, and which ones embody their connection to the land.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We must therefore build around a sacred site a series of spaces which gradually intensify and converge on the site.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If the site is very large - a mountain - the same approach can be taken with special places from which it can be seen - an inner sanctum, reached past many levels, which is not the mountain, but a garden, say, from which the mountain can be seen in special beauty.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Give every sacred site a place, or a sequence of places, where people can relax, enjoy themselves, and feel the presence of the place QUIET BACKS, ZEN VIEW, TREE PLACES, GARDEN SEAT.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Above all, shield the approach to the site, so that it can only be approached on foot, and through a series of gateways and thresholds which reveal it gradually - HOLY GROUND.....</p>
