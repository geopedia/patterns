<p>Summary 1:  Now, where there is a special need to emphasize a path - PATHS AND GOALS - or, even more important, where the edges between two parts of a garden need to be marked without making a wall, an open trellised walk which can enclose space, is required.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Where paths need special protection or where they need some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it with climbing flowers.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In PATH SHAPE, we have described the need for outdoor paths to have a shape, like rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Use it to emphasize the path it covers, and to set off one part of the path as a special section of a longer path in order to make it an especially nice and inviting place to walk.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Since the trellised path creates enclosure around the spaces which it bounds, use it to create a virtual wall to define an outdoor space.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Pave the path with loosely set stones - PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES - Use climbing plants and a fine trellis work to create the special quality of soft, filtered light underneath the trellis - FILTERED LIGHT, CLIMBING PLANTS .....</p>
