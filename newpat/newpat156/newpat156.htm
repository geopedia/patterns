<p>Summary 1:  First of all, what do we mean by &quot;Settled work&quot;? It is the work which unites all the threads of a person&#039;s life into one activity: the activity becomes a complete and wholehearted extension of the person behind it.</p>
<p>Summary 2: There is the bureaucrat who finally breaks through all the paper work and finds the underlying organic function in his work.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Even in the self-governing workshops and offices, where working procedures are created ad hoc by the workers as they go, the work itself is generally geared to the demands of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Summary 4: To solve the problem, we must first of all create a working environment, where a person, from say middle age, has the opportunity of slowly developing a kind of settled work that is right for him.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If the time is increased gradually over the years, a person can explore various kinds of work; and gradually let the settled work replace his working life.</p>
<p>Summary 6: We make special mention of settled work as the work of old age, because, even though it must begin early on in a person&#039;s life, it is in old age that having such work becomes a necessity..</p>
