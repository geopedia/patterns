<p>Summary 1:  Some of the area around interchanges should be given over to houses for those people who rely entirely on public transportation - especially old people.</p>
<p>Summary 2: To meet their needs, the area around interchanges must be zoned so that the kind of housing that suits them will develop there - OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The interchange must be convenient for people walking from their homes and jobs, and it must be safe.</p>
<p>Summary 4: People will not use an interchange if it is dingy, derelict, and deserted.</p>
<p>Summary 5: There must be enough shops and kiosks in the interchange, to keep a steady flow of people moving in and out of it and through it.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place HOUSING HILLS, OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, and WORK COMMUNITIES round the interchange; treat the outside of the interchange as an ACTIVITY NODE to assure its continuity with the pedestrian network; treat the transfers as ARCADES where necessary to keep them under cover; give every interchange a BUS STOP on the MINI-BUS network.....</p>
