<p>Summary 1:  In some cases, you will probably have laid out the walls and flowers and seats, at least in rough outline; but it is usually best to make the final decisions about them after the building is really there - so that you can make them fit the building and help to tie it into its surround ings - PATH SHAPE, ACTIVITY POCKETS, PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, BUILDING EDGE, SUNNY PLACE, OUTDOOR ROOM, CONNECTION TO THE EARTH, TRELLISED WALK, GARDEN SEAT, etc.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Choosing good spots for outdoor seats is far more important than building fancy benches.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We made random spot checks on selected benches in Berkeley, California, and recorded these facts about each bench: Was it occupied or empty? Did it give a view of current activity or not? Was it in the sun or not? What was the current wind velocity? Three of the eleven benches were occupied; eight were empty.</p>
<p>Summary 4: At the moment of observation, all three occupied benches looked onto activity, were in the sun, and had a wind velocity of less than 1-5 feet per second.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Three of them had shelter and activity but no sun; three of them had activity but no sun, and wind greater than 3 feet per second; two of them had sun and shelter but no activity.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If these seats can be made continuous with stairs or building entrances or low walls or ballustrades, so much the better - STAIR SEATS, FRONT DOOR BENCH, SITTING WALL.....</p>
