<p>Summary 1:  Once you have a rough column plan for the building - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS, FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION - you are ready to start the site work itself.</p>
<p>Summary 2: First, stake out the positions of the ground floor columns, before you do any other earthwork, so that you can move the columns whenever necessary to leave rocks or plants intact - SITE REPAIR, CONNECTION TO THE EARTH.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Try to find a way of making foundations in which the columns themselves go right into the earth, and spread out there - so that the footing is continuous with the material of the column, and the column, with its footing, like a tree root, can resist tension and horizontal shear as well as compression.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When the column and the foundations are separate elements which have to be connected, the connection becomes a difficult and critical joint.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Since columns start out hollow, BOX COLUMNS, we can form a root foundation by setting the hollow column into the foundation pit, and then pouring the lower part of the column and the foundation, integrally, in a single pour.</p>
<p>Summary 6: To make foundations like this for hollow concrete, filled box columns, start with a pit for each foundation, place the&#039;hollow column in the pit, and pour the column and the foundation integrally, in one continuous pour - BOX COLUMNS..</p>
