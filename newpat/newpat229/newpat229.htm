<p>Summary 1:  In a building built according to the principle, of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE and built with vaulted floors - FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS, there is a triangular volume, unused, around the edge of every room.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make ducts to carry hot air conduit, plumbing, gas, and other services in the triangular space, within the vault, around the upper edge of every room.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Connect the ducts for different rooms by vertical ducts, in special chases, in the corners of rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In most buildings electric conduits, plumbing, drains, gas pipes, telephone wires, and so on, are buried in the walls, in a completely uncoordinated and disorganized way.</p>
<p>Summary 5: This makes the initial construction of the building complicated since it is difficult to coordinate the installation of the various services with the building of various parts of the building.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Heating and electrical conduits will be universal throughout the building and should thus be run around every room..</p>
