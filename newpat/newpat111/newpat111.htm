<p>Summary 1:  If a garden is too close to the street, people won&#039;t use it because it isn&#039;t private enough.</p>
<p>Summary 2: How often are people sitting there? Except at those special moments, when people want specifically to be watching the street, the front garden is nothing but a decoration.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Often the back garden is so remote from the street, that you can&#039;t hear people coming to the house; you have no sense of any larger, more open space, no sense of other people - only the enclosed, isolated, fenced-in world of one family.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The garden: needs a certain degree of privacy, yet also wants some kind of tenuous connection to the street and entrance.</p>
<p>Summary 5: To create half-hidden gardens, the lots must be long along the street, and shallow, so that each house can have a garden at its side.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If possible, use this pattern to influence the shape of house lots too, and make them as near double squares along the street as possible; build a partial wall around the garden, and locate the entrance to the house between the house and the garden, so that people in the garden can be private, yet still aware of the street, and aware of anybody coming up to the house - MAIN ENTRANCE, GARDEN WALL; allow the garden to grow wild GARDEN GROWING WILD, and make the passage through, or alongside it, a major part of the transition between street and house - ENTRANCE TRANSITION..</p>
