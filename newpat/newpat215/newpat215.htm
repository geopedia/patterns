<p>Summary 1:  The slab is the easiest, cheapest, and most natural way to lay a ground floor.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build a ground floor slab, raised slightly - six or nine inches above the ground - by first building a low perimeter wall around the building, tied into the column foundations, and then filling it with rubble, gravel, and concrete.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A raised ground floor slab built inside a brick perimeter wall.</p>
<p>Summary 4: When the ground is relatively level, a concrete slab which sits directly on the ground is the most natural and cheapest way of building a ground floor.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Build the low wall which forms the edge of the ground floor slab out of brick, and tie it directly into all the terraces and paths around the building - CONNECTION TO THE EARTH, SOFT TILE AND BRICK.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If you are building on a steep sloped site, build part of the ground floor as a vaulted floor instead of excavating to form a slab - FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS.....</p>
