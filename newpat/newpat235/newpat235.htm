<p>Summary 1:  If it is possible to use a soft material for the inner sheet of the wall membrane, then the wall will have the right character built in from the beginning.</p>
<p>Summary 2: A wall which is too hard or too cold or too solid is unpleasant to touch; it makes decoration impossible, and creates hollow echoes.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In general, we have found that modern construction has gone more and more toward materials for inside walls that are hard and smooth.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Walls finished in wood have the quality - the wood itself has texture; boards repeat it at a larger scale.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The walls are plastered, by hand, with a mixture of cow dung and mud, which dries to a beautiful soft finish and shows the five fingers of the plasterer&#039;s hand all over the walls.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In our own building system, we find it is worth putting on a light skim coat of plaster over the inner surfaces of the WALL MEMBRANE and FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS..</p>
