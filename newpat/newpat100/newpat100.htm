<p>Summary 1:  Arrange buildings so that they form pedestrian streets with many entrances and open stairs directly from the upper storys to the street, so that even movement between rooms is outdoors, not just movement between buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Most of the moving about which people do is indoors - hence lost to the street; the street becomes abandoned and dangerous.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Individual wings, small buildings, departments must as often as possible have their own entrances - so that the number of entrances onto the street increases and life comes back to the street.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In short, the solution to these two problems we have mentioned - the streets infected by cars and the bland corridors - is the pedestrian street.</p>
<p>Summary 5: First, of course, no cars; but frequent crossings by streets with traffic, see NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS: deliveries and other activities which make it essential to bring cars and trucks onto the pedestrian street must be arranged at the early hours of the morning, when the streets are deserted.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make frequent entrances and open stairs along the street, instead of building indoor corridors, to bring the people out; and give these entrances a family resemblance so one sees them as a system - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES, OPEN STAIRS; give people indoor and outdoor spaces which look on the street - PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, STREET WINDOWS, OPENING TO THE STREET, GALLERY SURROUND, SIX-FOOT BALCONY; and shape the street to make a space of it - ARCADE, PATH SHAPE.....</p>
