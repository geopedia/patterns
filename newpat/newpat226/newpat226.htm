<p>Summary 1:  Certain columns, especially those which are free standing, play an important social role, beyond their structural role as COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Thin columns, spindly columns, columns which take their shape from structural arguments alone, will never make a comfortable environment.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When a column is free standing, make it as thick as a man - at least 12 inches, preferably 16 inches: and form places around it where people can sit and lean comfortably: a step, a small seat built up against the column, or a space formed by a pair of columns.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Four inch steel pipes or 6 inch reinforced concrete columns break up space, but they destroy it as a place for human action, because they do not create &quot;Spots&quot; where people can be comfortable.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In short, if the column has to be there, it will destroy a considerable area unless it is made to be a place where people feel comfortable to stay, a natural focus, a place to sit down, a place to lean.</p>
<p>Summary 6: You can get the extra thickness quite cheaply if you build the column as a BOX COLUMN; complete the &quot;Place&quot; the column forms, by giving it a &quot;Roof&quot; in the form of a column capital, or vault which springs from the column, or by bracing the column against the beams - COLUMN CONNECTION..</p>
