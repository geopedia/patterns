<p>Summary 1:  If the entrances are in position - MAIN ENTRANCE; and the pattern of movement through the building is established - THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS, SHORT PASSAGES, the main stairs must be put in and given an appropriate social character.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Place the main stair in a key position, central and visible.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Flare out the bottom of the stair with open windows or balustrades and with wide-steps so that the people coming down the stair become part of the action in the room while they are on the stair, and so that people below will naturally use the stair for seats.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The first four or five steps are the places where people are most likely to sit if the stair is working well.</p>
<p>Summary 5: On the one hand, of course, the stair is the key to movement in a building.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat the bottom steps as STAIR SEATS; provide a window or a view half-way up the stair, both to light the stair and to create a natural focus of attention - ZEN VIEW(134), TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK; remember to calculate the length and shape of the stair while you are working out its position - STAIRCASE VOLUME..</p>
