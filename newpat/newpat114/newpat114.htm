<p>Summary 1:  The main outdoor spaces are given their character by SITE REPAIR, SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS and POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE.</p>
<p>Summary 2: You can refine them, and complete their character by making certain that every space always has a view out into some other larger one, and that all the spaces work together to form hierarchies.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Outdoors, people always try to find a spot where they can have their backs protected, looking out toward some larger opening, beyond the space immediately in front of them.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Whatever space you are shaping - whether it is a garden, terrace, street, park, public outdoor room, or courtyard, make sure of two things.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In the very smallest of outdoor spaces, in private gardens, this pattern tells you to make a corner of the space as a &quot;Back&quot; with a seat, looking out on the garden.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Slightly larger in scale, there is the connection between a terrace or an outdoor room of some kind and a larger open space, the street or a square..</p>
