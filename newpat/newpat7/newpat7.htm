<p>Summary 1: Define all farms as parks, where the public has a right to be; and make all regional parks into working farms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The stewards are given a lease for the land, and they are free to tend the land and set ground rules for its use - as a small farm, a forest, marshland, desert, and so forth.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Every piece of countryside has keepers who have the right to farm it, if it is arable; or the obligation to look after it, if it is wild; and every piece of land is open to the people at large, provided they respect the organic processes which are going on there.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land....</p>
<p>Summary 5: If we continue to treat the land as an instrument for our enjoyment, and as a source of economic profit, our parks and camps will become more artificial, more plastic, more like Disneyland.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The land ethic replaces the idea of public parks and public campgrounds with the concept of a single countryside..</p>
