<p>Summary 1:  Choose the realms so that each one can be easily named, so that you can tell a person where to go, simply by telling him which realms to go through.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The map guides you to the entrance of the largest realm, and from there to the entrance of the next largest realm, and so on.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The realms are: Manhattan, Districts, Realms defined by the avenues, and Realms defined by cross streets and individual buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Each realm has a main circulation space, which opens directly from the entrances to that realm.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The entrances to any realm open directly off the circulation space of the next larger realm above it.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat the first entrances to the whole system of circulation realms, the very largest ones, as gateways - MAIN GATEWAYS; make the major realms, which open off the gateways, pedestrian streets or common land - COMMON LAND, PEDESTRIAN STREET; then, make minor realms with individual buildings, and courtyards, and major indoor streets - MAIN BUILDING, BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE; and mark the entrance to these minor realms with minor entrances that still stand out quite clearly - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES, MAIN ENTRANCE..</p>
