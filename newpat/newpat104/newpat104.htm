<p>Summary 1:  The most general aspects of a building complex are established in BUILDING COMPLEX, NUMBER OF STORIES, and CIRCULATION REALMS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: What usually happens when someone thinks of building on a piece of land? He looks for the best site - where the grass is most beautiful, the trees most healthy, the slope of the land most even, the view most lovely, the soil most fertile - and that is just where he decides to put his house.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When the construction starts on the parts of the land which are already healthy, innumerable beauties are wiped out with every act of building.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If we always build on that part of the land which is most healthy, we can be virtually certain that a great deal of the land will always be less than healthy.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We must treat every new act of building as an opportunity to mend some rent in the existing cloth; each act of building gives us the chance to make one of the ugliest and least healthy parts of the environment more healthy - as for those parts which are already healthy and beautiful - they of course need no attention.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Above all, leave trees intact and build around them with great care - TREE PLACES; keep open spaces open to the south of buildings, for the sun -SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS; try, generally, to shape space in such a way that each place becomes positive, in its own right - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE..</p>
