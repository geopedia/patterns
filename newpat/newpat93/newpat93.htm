<p>Summary 1:  All draw their life, to some extent, from the food stands, the hawkers, and the vendors who fill the street with the smell of food.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Concentrate food stands where cars and paths meet - either portable stands or small huts, or built into the fronts of buildings, half-open to the street.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The food stands which make the best food, and which contribute most to city life, are the smallest shacks and carts from which individual vendors sell their wares.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If we want food in our streets contributing to the social life of the streets, not helping to destroy it, the food stands must be made and placed accordingly.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The best food always comes from family restaurants; and the best food in a foodstand always comes when people prepare the food and sell it themselves, according to their own ideas, their own recipes, their own choice.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat these food stands as ACTIVITY POCKETS when they are part of a square; Use canvas roofs to make a simple shelter over them - CANVAS ROOF ; and keep them in line with the precepts of INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS: the best food always comes from people who are in business for themselves, who buy the raw food, and prepare it in their own style.....</p>
