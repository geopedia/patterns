<p>Summary 1:  In such a house or office there are strong reasons to make the building even longer and thinner still.</p>
<p>Summary 2: These shapes increase the separation between places inside the building and therefore increase the relative privacy which people are able to get within a given area.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A small building can actually be much narrower than people imagine.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We have seen successful buildings as narrow as 12 feet wide - indeed, Richard Neutra&#039;s own house in Los Angeles is even less.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A building which is 12 feet square, and three stories high, with an exterior stair, makes a wonderful house.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use the long thin plan to help shape outdoor space on the site - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE; the long perimeter of the building sets the stage for INTIMACY GRADIENT and for the CASCADE OF ROOFS..</p>
