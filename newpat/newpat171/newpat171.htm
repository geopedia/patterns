<p>Summary 1:  If you have followed SITE REPAIR, you have already taken care to leave the trees intact and undisturbed by new construction; you may have planted FRUIT TREES; and you may perhaps also have other additional trees in mind.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If you are planting trees, plant them according to their nature, to form enclosures, avenues, squares, groves, and single spreading trees toward the middle of open spaces.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Shape the nearby buildings in response to trees, so that the trees themselves, and the trees and buildings together, form places which people can use.</p>
<p>Summary 4: For the most part, the trees that are being planted and transplanted in cities and suburbs today do not satisfy people&#039;s craving for trees.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Trees have the potential to create various kinds of social places: an umbrella - where a single, low-sprawling tree like an oak defines an outdoor room; a pair - where two trees form a gateway; a grove - where several trees cluster together; a square - where they enclose an open space; and an avenue - where a double row of trees, their crowns touching, line a path or street.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the trees form &quot;Rooms&quot; and spaces, avenues, and squares, and groves, by placing trellises between the trees, and walks, and seats under the trees themselves - OUTDOOR ROOM, TRELLISED WALK, GARDEN SEAT, SEAT SPOTS..</p>
