<p>Summary 1:  The mix of households in an area does almost more than anything else to generate, or destroy, the character of an IDENTIFlABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, of a HOUSE CLUSTER, of a WORK COMMUNITY, or, most generally of all, of a LIFE CYCLE.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Encourage growth toward a mix of household types in every neighborhood, and every cluster, so that one-person households, couples, families with children, and group households are side by side.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Such contact is completely foiled if the housing mix in one&#039;s neighborhood is skewed toward one or two stages only.</p>
<p>Summary 4: First, determine the percentage of each household type for the region as a whole; second, use the same percentages to guide the gradual growth of the housing mix within the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Let us ask, finally, how large a group should the mix be applied to? We might try to create a mix in every house, or in every cluster of a dozen houses, or in every neighborhood, or merely in every town.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make especially sure there are provisions for old people in every neighborhood OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, and that even with this mix, young children will have enough playmates - CONNECTED PLAY; and build the details of the different kinds of households, according to the appropriate more detailed patterns to reinforce the mix - THE FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A COUPLE, HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON .....</p>
