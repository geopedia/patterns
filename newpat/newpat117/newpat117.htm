<p>Summary 1:  Slope the roof or make a vault of it, make its entire surface visible, and bring the eaves of the roof down low, as low as 6&#039;0&quot; or 6&#039;6&quot; at places like the entrance, where people pause.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Build the top story of each wing right into the roof, so that the roof does not only cover it, but actually surrounds it.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In one study, the importance of images - i.e., symbols - for house form is stressed, and the pitched roof is said to be symbolic of shelter while the flat roof is not, and is therefore unacceptable on symbolic grounds.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Despite 50 years of the flat roofs of the &quot;Modern movement,&quot; people still find the simple pitched roof the most powerful symbol of shelter.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Get the exact shape of the cross section from ROOF VAULTS ; use the space inside the top of the sloped roof for BULK STORAGE; where the roof comes down low, perhaps make it continuous with an ARCADE or GALLERY SURROUND.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Build the roof flat, not sloped, only where people can get out to it to use it as a garden - ROOF GARDENS; where rooms are built into the roof, make windows in the roof - DORMER WINDOWS - If the building plan is complex, get the exact way that different sloped roofs meet from ROOF LAYOUT..</p>
