<p>Summary 1:  If the edge of one vault is more than a couple of feet from the edge of the vault below it - then the lower vault will have to contain an arch to support the load from the upper vault.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Either you can level out the floor by making the smaller vaults have proportionately higher arches, or you can put extra material in between to keep the small vaults low - see CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY, or you can make steps in the floor above to correspond to changes in the vault sizes below.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If one vault is placed so that its loads come down over the arch of the vault below, this will put undue stress on the lower vault.</p>
<p>Summary 4: To maintain reasonable structural integrity in the system of vaults as a whole, we therefore suggest that every vault be placed so that its loads come down in a position from which the forces can go to the columns which support the next vault down, by following a 45 degree diagonal.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The roof itself is generally a barrel vault - see ROOF VAULT - so it is most natural to give the ceiling of the space just under the roof a barrel vault as well.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Get the shape of the vaults from FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS and as you lay out the sections through the vaults, bear in mind that the perimeter beams get lower and lower on higher floors, because the columns on upper stories must be shorter - FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION..</p>
