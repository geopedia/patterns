<p>Summary 1:  On paths and terraces, lay paving stones with a 1 inch crack between the stones, so that grass and mosses and small flowers can grow between the stones.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Lay the stones directly into earth, not into mortar, and, of course, use no cement or mortar in between the stones.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Look at a simple path, made by laying bricks or paving stones directly in the earth, with ample cracks between the stones.</p>
<p>Summary 4: You walk from stone to stone, and feel the earth directly under foot.</p>
<p>Summary 5: All these are good reasons to set paving stones loosely.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use paving with cracks, to help make paths and terraces which change and show the passage of time and so help people feel the earth beneath their feet - CONNECTION TO THE EARTH; the stones themselves are best if they are simple soft baked tiles - SOFT TILE AND BRICK.....</p>
