<p>Summary 1:  The movement between rooms is as important as the rooms themselves; and its arrangement has as much effect on social interaction in the rooms, as the interiors of the rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In a building where the movement is mean, the passages are dark and narrow - rooms open off them as dead ends; you spend your time entering the building, or moving between rooms, like a crab scuttling in the dark.</p>
<p>Summary 3: When such a loop passes through rooms, it connects rooms far more than a simple passage does.</p>
<p>Summary 4: A building where there is a chain of rooms in sequence also works like this, if there is a passage in parallel with the chain of rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Always make sure that these rooms for movement have plenty of light in them and perhaps a view - ZEN VIEW, TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK, and LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Keep doors which open into rooms, or doors between rooms which create the flow through rooms, in the corners of the rooms - CORNER DOORS(196).....</p>
