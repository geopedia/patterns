<p>Summary 4: There is another argument which helps to explain the importance of the transition: people want their house, and especially the entrance, to be a private domain.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Emphasize the momentary view which marks the transition by a glimpse of a distant place - ZEN VIEW ; perhaps make a gateway or a simple garden gate to mark the entrance - GARDEN WALL ; and emphasize the change of light - TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK, TRELLISED WALK.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The transition runs right up to the front door, up to the ENTRANCE ROOM, and marks the beginning of the INTIMACY GRADIENT .....</p>
