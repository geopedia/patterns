<p>Summary 1:  The common land in MAIN GATEWAYS, ACCESSIBLE GREEN, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES, COMMON LAND, PEDESTRIAN STREET, PATHS AND GOALS needs at least some place where hanging out and being &quot;Out&quot; in public become possible.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In every neighborhood and work community, make a piece of the common land into an outdoor room - a partly enclosed place, with some roof, columns, without walls, perhaps with a trellis; place it beside an important path and within view of many homes and workshops.</p>
<p>Summary 3: According to staff reports, these places changed the life of the clinic dramatically: many more people than had been usual were drawn into the outdoors, public talk was more animated, outdoor space that had always been dominated by automobiles suddenly became human and the cars had to inch along.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Public outdoor room built by Chatin and Gordon in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In all, Chapin and Gordon and their crew built seven public outdoor rooms in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place the outdoor room where several paths are tangent to it, like any other common area - COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART; in the bulge of a path - PATH SHAPE; or around a square - ACTIVITY POCKETS; use surrounding BUILDING EDGES to define part of it; build it like any smaller outdoor room, with columns, and half-trellised roofs - OUTDOOR ROOM; perhaps put an open courtyard next to it - COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE, an ARCADE around the edge, or other simple cover - CANVAS ROOFS, and seats for casual sitting - STAIR SEATS, SEAT SPOTS.....</p>
