<p>Summary 1:  Don&#039;t put single beds in empty rooms called bedrooms, but instead put individual bed alcoves off rooms with other nonsleeping functions, so the bed itself becomes a tiny private haven.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The valuable space around the bed is good for nothing except access to the bed.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In BED CLUSTERS, we have already argued that each child in a family should have a bed alcove of his own, opening off a common play-space.</p>
<p>Summary 4: First, the bed in a bedroom creates awkward spaces around it: dressing, working, watching television, sitting, are all rather foreign to the side spaces left over around a bed.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We have found that people have a hard time adapting the space around the bed to their needs for bedroom space.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Once the bed has been built into a space that is right for it, then the rest of the bedrom space is free to shape itself around the needs for sitting space, play areas, dressing, and storage..</p>
