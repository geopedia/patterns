<p>Summary 1:  At the main entrance to a building, make a light-filled room which marks the entrance and straddles the boundary between indoors and outdoors, covering some space outdoors and some space indoors.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The entrance room therefore needs a window -or windows - on the path from the family room or kitchen to the door, facing the area outside the door from the side.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Give the entrance room a clearly defined area, at least 20 square feet, outside the front door, raised with a natural threshold - perhaps a railing, or a low wall, or a step-between it and the visitors&#039; cars.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Make the inside of the entrance room zigzag, or obstructed, so that a person standing on the doorstep of the open door can see no rooms inside, except the entrance room itself, nor through the doors of any rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Give the entrance room a dead corner for storage, put coat pegs in a position which can be seen from the front door, and make an area five feet in diameter next to the pegs.</p>
<p>Summary 6: As for the indoor part of the entrance room, above all, make sure that it is filled with light from two or even three sides, so that the first impression of the building is of light - TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK, LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM..</p>
