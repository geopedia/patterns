<p>Summary 1: The motions we call bathing are mere ablutions which formerly preceded the bath.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The place where they are performed, though adequate for the routine, does not deserve to be called a bathroom.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Rudofsky points out that cleaning up is only a small part of bathing; that bathing as a whole is a far more basic activity, with therapeutic and pleasurable aspects.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If we imagine a large bathing room, large enough to make bathing a pleasure, we see that we can certainly not afford more than one of them per family.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Visitors must be able to use the bathing room, and must therefore be able to reach it without passing through the private rooms or bedrooms.</p>
<p>Summary 6: We imagine solid unlockable doors to the bathing room as a whole; perhaps swinging doors to establish the fluidity of the area; and then opaque glass doors or curtains on the shower stall; a simple door for the toilet stalls - this is the most private spot; and an open doorway to the alcove which contains the bath.</p>
