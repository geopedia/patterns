<p>Summary 1:  Throughout the building - SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES - there are alcoves, entrances, corners, and windows where it is natural to make built-in seats - ENTRANCE ROOM, ALCOVES, WINDOW PLACE.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Before you build the seat, get hold of an old arm chair or a sofa, and put it into the position where you intend to build a seat.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Now build a seat that is just as wide, and just as well padded - and your built-in seat will work.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Why do built-in seats so often not work properly? The reasons are simple and fairly easy to correct.</p>
<p>Summary 5: If you want to build a seat, ask yourself where you would place a sofa or a comfortable armchair-and build the seat there, not tucked into some hopeless corner.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Built-in seats often place you so that you are facing away from the view or away from the other people in the room..</p>
