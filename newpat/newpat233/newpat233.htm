<p>Summary 1:  The wood floor, though it seems so beautiful, does little to solve the fundamental problem of floors.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When we look at the problem honestly, we realize that the wooden floor, and the wooden floor with a carpet on it, are both rather uneven compromises.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The bare wooden floor is too bare, too hard to be comfortable; but not in fact hard enough to resist wear particularly well if it is left uncovered - it scratches and dents and splinters.</p>
<p>Summary 4: On the floor is certainly not hard enough to resist any substantial wear.</p>
<p>Summary 5: On the hard floor, you can use the same floor as you use on outdoor paths and terraces - hand fired brick and tile - SOFT TILE AND BRICK.</p>
<p>Summary 6: On the soft intimate floors, use materials and cloths that are rich in ornament and color - ORNAMENT, WARM COLORS.....</p>
