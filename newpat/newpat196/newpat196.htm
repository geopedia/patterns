<p>Summary 1:  If the doors create a pattern of movement which destroys the places in the room, the room will never allow people to be comfortable.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In most rooms, especially small ones, put the doors as near the corners of the room as possible.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If the room has two doors, and people move through it, keep both doors at one end of the room.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Now, the case of a room with two or more doors: the individual doors should still be in the corners for the reasons given above.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In a very large room, or in a room with a big table in the middle, the doors can be in the middle, and still create a special formal, spacious feeling.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Later, when you make the door frame, make it integral with the wall, and decorate it freely - FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES, ORNAMENT; except when rooms are very private, put windows in the door - SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS.....</p>
