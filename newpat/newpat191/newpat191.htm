<p>Summary 1:  With occasional exceptions, make each indoor space or each position of a space, a rough rectangle, with roughly straight walls, near right angles in the corners, and a roughly symmetrical vault over each room.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Since a social space is convex - see the extensive argument in POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE - it must either have a wall which is concave or a wall which is perfectly straight.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Every wall with social spaces on both sides of it, must have straight walls, except where it is thick enough to be concave on both sides.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Polygon, rough rectangle, thick curved wall, exterior curved wall.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Avoid curved walls except where they are strictly necessary - WALL MEMBRANES.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Make the walls of each room generous and deep -THICK WALLS, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS; and where it is appropriate, make them HALF-OPEN WALLS..</p>
