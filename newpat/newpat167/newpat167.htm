<p>Summary 1:  Whenever you build a balcony, a porch, a gallery, or a terrace always make it at least six feet deep.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Our observations make it clear that the difference between deep balconies and those which are not deep enough is simply astonishing.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Almost no balconies which are more than six feet deep are not used.</p>
<p>Summary 4: As far as enclosure goes, we have noticed that among the deeper balconies, it is those with half-open enclosures around them - columns, wooden slats, rose-covered trellises - which are used most.</p>
<p>Summary 5: On a cantilevered balcony people must sit outside the mass of the building; the balcony lacks privacy and tends to feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In an English study, two-thirds of the people that never used their balconies gave lack of privacy as their reason, and said that they preferred recessed balconies, because, in contrast to cantilevered balconies, the recesses seemed more secure..</p>
