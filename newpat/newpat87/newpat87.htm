<p>Summary 1:  The STREET CAFE and CORNER GROCERY and all the individual shops and stalls in SHOPPING STREETS and MARKETS OF MANY SHOPS must be supported by an ordinance which guarantees that they will stay in local private hands, and not be owned by absentee landlords, or chain stores, or giant franchise operations.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When shops are too large, or controlled by absentee owners, they become plastic, bland, and abstract.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Do what you can to encourage the development of individually owned shops.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The individual managers have almost no control over the goods they sell, the food they serve; policies are tightly controlled; the personal quality of individually owned shops is altogether broken down.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Many hundreds of tiny shops, with low rents, will keep the initial risk for a shop keeper who is starting, to a minimum.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat each individual shop as an identifiable unit of a larger BUILDING COMPLEX; make at least some part of the shop part of the sidewalk, so that people walk through the shop as they are going down the street - OPENING TO THE STREET ; and build the inside of the shop with all the goods as open and available as possible - THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE, THICK WALLS, OPEN SHELVES..</p>
