<p>Summary 1:  Then choose the height of your buildings according to the floor area ratio and the height of the surrounding buildings from the following table.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Rule 2: For any given site, do not let the ground area covered by buildings exceed 50 per cent of the site.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The ratio of indoor area to site area cannot thus exceed 0.5 in a single story building, 1.0 in a two story, 1.5 in a three story and 2.0 in a four story building.</p>
<p>Summary 4: A rule of thumb: do not let your buildings deviate more than one story from surrounding buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Once you have the number of stories and the area of each part clear, decide which building or which part of the building will be the MAIN BUILDING.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Place the buildings on the site, with special reverence for the land, and trees, and sun - SITE REPAIR, SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS, TREE PLACES..</p>
