<p>Summary 1:  Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of culture.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Wherever possible, work toward the evolution of independent regions in the world; each with a population between 2 and 10 million; each with its own natural and geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each one autonomous and self-governing; each with a seat in a world government, without the intervening power of larger states or countries.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Support for the intensity and diversity of human cultures.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In short, we believe that independent regions are the natural receptacles for language, culture, customs, economy, and laws and that each region should be separate and independent enough to maintain the strength and vigor of its culture.</p>
<p>Summary 5: We are suggesting here that the same argument also applies to regions - that the regions of the earth must also keep their distance and their dignity in order to survive as cultures.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Within each region encourage the population to distribute itself as widely as possible across the region - THE DISTRIBUTION OF TOWNS.....</p>
