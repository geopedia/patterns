<p>Summary 1:  The relationship of a house to a street is often confused: either the house opens entirely to the street and there is no privacy; or the house turns its back on the street, and communion with street life is lost.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Let the common rooms open onto a wide terrace or a porch which looks into the street.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Raise the terrace slightly above street level and protect it with a low wall, which you can see over if you sit near it, but which prevents people on the street from looking into the common rooms.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Where the street is quiet enough, and the house near enough to the street, we cannot imagine a much better solution.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When he built beside lively streets he built a wide terrace between the living room and the street.</p>
<p>Summary 6: There are empirical grounds for believing that the need for a house to be in touch with the street outside is a fundamental psychological necessity: and that its opposite - the tendency some people have to keep their houses away from the street, locked up, barred, and disconnected from the street - is a symptom of a serious emotional disorder - the autonomy-withdrawal syndrome..</p>
