<p>Summary 1:  Available evidence suggests, first, that the neighborhoods which people identify with have extremely small populations; second, that they are small in area; and third, that a major road through a neighborhood destroys it.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Neighborhood with moderate traffic - 6000 vehicles/day - 550 vehicles/peak hour - 25 mph - Two-way Residents speaking on &quot;Neighboring and visiting&quot; :&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see the neighbors but they aren&#039;t close friends.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Neighborhood with heavy traffic - 16,000 vehicles/day - 1900 vehicles/peak hour - 35-40 mph - One-way Residents speaking on &quot;Neighboring and visiting&quot;:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It&#039;s not a friendly street - no one offers help.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In short, the issue of traffic is so fundamental to the fact of neighborhoods, that neighborhoods emerge, and crystallize, as soon as people are asked to decide where they want nearby traffic to be.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Mark the neighborhood, above all, by gateways wherever main paths enter it - MAIN GATEWAYS - and by modest boundaries of non-residential land between the neighborhoods - NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Keep major roads within these boundaries - PARALLEL ROADS; give the neighborhood a visible center, perhaps a common or a green - ACCESSIBLE GREENor a SMALL PUBLIC SQUARE; and arrange houses and workshops within the neighborhood in clusters of about a dozen at a time - HOUSE CLUSTER, WORK COMMUNITY.....</p>
