<p>Summary 1:  Building set-backs from the street, originally invented to protect the public welfare by giving every building light and air, have actually helped greatly to destroy the street as a social space.</p>
<p>Summary 2: On no account allow set-backs between streets or paths or public open land and the buildings which front on them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Let the building fronts take on slightly uneven angles as they accommodate to the shape of the street.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The early twentieth-century urge for &quot;Cleanliness&quot; at all costs, and the social efforts to clean up slums, led social reformers to pass laws which make it necessary to place buildings several feet back from the street edge, to make sure that buildings cannot crowd the street and cut off sunshine, light, and air.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Detail the fronts of buildings, indeed the whole building perimeter, according to the pattern BUILDING EDGE.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If some outdoor space is needed at the front of the building, make it part of the street life by making it a PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET or GALLERY SURROUND; and give the building many openings onto the street - STAIR SEATS, OPEN STAIRS, STREET WINDOWS, OPENING TO THE STREET, FRONT DOOR BENCH.....</p>
