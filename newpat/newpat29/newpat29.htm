<p>Summary 1:  Much better, if you can possibly manage it, play the density rings game, to obtain these densities, from the intuitions of the very people who are going to live in the community.</p>
<p>Summary 2: In order to be precise about the gradient of housing densities, let us agree at once, to analyze the densities by means of three concentric semi-circular rings, of equal radial thickness, around the main center of activity.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We now define a density gradient, as a set of three densities, one for each of the three rings.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Within the rings of density, encourage housing to take the form of housing clusters - self-governing cooperatives of 8 to 15 households, their physical size varying according to the density - HOUSE CLUSTER.</p>
<p>Summary 5: According to the densities in the different rings, build these houses as free-standing houses -HOUSE CLUSTER, ROW HOUSES, or higher density clusters of housing - HOUSING HILL.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Keep public spaces - PROMENADE, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES to those areas which have a high enough density around them to keep them alive PEDESTRIAN DENSITY .....</p>
