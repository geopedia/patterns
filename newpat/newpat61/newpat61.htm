<p>Summary 1:  Make a public square much smaller than you would at first imagine; usually no more than 45 to 60 feet across, never more than 70 feet across.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When the diameter gets above 70 feet, the squares begin to seem deserted and unpleasant.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The only exceptions we know are places like the Piazza San Marco and Trafalgar Square, which are great town centers, teeming with people.</p>
<p>Summary 4: What possible functional basis is there for these observations? First, we know from the pattern, PEDESTRIAN DENSITY, that a place begins to seem deserted when it has more than about 300 square feet per person.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Since there are far far better chances Of 4 or 12 people being in a certain place than 33, the smaller squares will feel comfortable for a far greater percentage of the time.</p>
<p>Summary 6: An even better estimate for the size of the square: make a guess about the number of people who will typically be there, and make the area of the square no greater than 150 to 300P square feet - PEDESTRIAN DENSITY; ring the square around with pockets of activity where people congregate - ACTIVITY POCKETS ; build buildings round the square in such a way that they give it a definite shape, with views out into other larger places - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE, HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, BUILDING FRONTS, STAIR SEATS; and to make the center of the square as useful as the edges, build SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE.....</p>
