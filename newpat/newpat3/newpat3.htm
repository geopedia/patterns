<p>Summary 1:  With the breakdown of contact between city dwellers and the countryside, the cities become prisons.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If we wish to re-establish and maintain the proper connection between city and country, and yet maintain the density of urban interactions, it will be necessary to stretch out the urbanized area into long sinuous fingers which extend into the farmland, shown in the diagram above.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Not only will the city be in the form of narrow fingers, but so will the farmlands adjacent to it.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The maximum width of the city fingers is determined by the maximum acceptable distance from the heart of the city to the countryside.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Whenever land is hilly, keep the country fingers in the valleys and the city fingers on the upper slopes of hillsides - AGRICULTURAL VALLEYS.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Break the city fingers into hundreds of distinct self-governing subcultures - MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES, and run the major roads and railways down the middle of these city fingers - WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, RING ROADS.....</p>
