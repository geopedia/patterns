<p>Summary 1:  If the common area and couple&#039;s realm are in position, it is now possible to weave in this partly separate, partly overlapping place for children, which we call a realm, although we recognize that it is not a separate realm but more an aspect of the house, reserved for children, a mode of functioning which is physically separate only in certain parts.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If children do not have space to release a tremendous amount of energy when they need to, they will drive themselves and everybody else in the family up the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We therefore conclude that all the places which children need and use should form one continuous geometrical swath, which does not include the couple&#039;s realm, the adult private rooms, or any formal, quiet sitting spaces.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The children&#039;s private spaces can be off the playspace, but it must be possible to close them off.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Children take up the suggestive qualities of spaces - on sight of a little cave-like space, they will decide to play house; on sight of a raised platform, they will decide to put on a play.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If there is an adequate children&#039;s world, in the manner described in this pattern, then both the adults and children can co-exist, each without dominating the other..</p>
