<p>Summary 1:  Create incentives so that all the different modes of public transportation - airplanes, helicopters, ferries, boats, trains, rapid transit, buses, mini-buses, skilifts, escalators, travelators, elevator - plan their lines to connect the interchanges, with the hope that gradually many different lines, of many different types, will meet at every interchange.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Give the local communities control over their interchanges so that they can implement the pattern by giving contracts only to those transportation companies which are willing to serve these interchanges.</p>
<p>Summary 3: We propose the opposite: namely, that interchanges are primary and that the transport lines are secondary elements which connect the interchanges.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The interchange chief coordinates the service at his interchange; he charters service from any number of transport companies - the companies, themselves, are in free competition with one another to create service.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The interchanges are responsible for connecting themselves to each other, and the community which uses the interchange decides what kinds of service they want to have passing through it.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Keep all the various lines that converge on a single interchange, and their parking, within 600 feet, so that people can transfer on foot - INTERCHANGE..</p>
