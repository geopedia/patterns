<p>Summary 1:  STAIRCASE AS A STAGE and OPEN STAIRS will tell you roughly where to place the various stairs, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The stair may be 2 feet wide or 5 feet wide for a generous shallow stair.</p>
<p>Summary 3: As you work out the exact slope of your stair, bear in mind the relationship: riser + tread=17.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Obviously, these stairs will not work; and the misunderstandings of the nature of the stair are so basic, that it is hard to correct these plans without destroying them.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In some cases - a very small house, a stair to the roof - such a shallow stair is a waste of space; a steep stair is far more appropriate.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Construct the staircase as a vault, within a space defined by columns, just like every other room - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS, STAIR VAULT..</p>
