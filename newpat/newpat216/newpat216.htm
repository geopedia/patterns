<p>Summary 1:  If you use ROOT FOUNDATIONS, the columns must be made at the same time as the foundations, since the foundation and the column are integral.</p>
<p>Summary 2: A column which has all these features is a box column, where the hollow tube can be made as thick as is required, and then filled with a strong compressive material.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Such a column can be made cheaper than comparable wood and steel columns; the outer skin can be made with a material that is beautiful, easy to repair, and soft to the touch; the column can be stiffened for bending, either by the skin itself, or by extra reinforcing; and, for structural integrity, the fill material can be made continuous with the column&#039;s footings and beams.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Some wire reinforcing inside the column is required to give the column tensile strength.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Once the columns are in position, put in the PERIMETER BEAMS, and fill the beams at the same time that you fill the upper part of the column.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If the column is free standing, put in column braces or column capitals - COLUMN CONNECTION - to brace the connection between the two..</p>
