<p>Summary 1:  In a healthy town every family can grow vegetables for itself.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Set aside one piece of land either in the private garden or on common land as a vegetable garden.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Make sure the vegetable garden is in a sunny place and central to all the households it serves.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If we compare dairy products, vegetables and fruits, meats, and synthetic foods, the vegetables play the most essential role.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Since the industrial revolution, there has been a growing tendency for people to rely on impersonal producers for their vegetables; however, in a world where vegetables are central and where self-sufficiency increases, it becomes as natural for families to have their own vegetables as their own air.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The amount of land it takes to grow the vegetables for a household is surprisingly small..</p>
