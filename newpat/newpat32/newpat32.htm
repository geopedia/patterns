<p>Summary 1:  Each time a shopping street gets built, it will also help to generate the WEB OF SHOPPING.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Encourage local shopping centers to grow in the form of short pedestrian streets, at right angles to major roads and opening off these roads with parking behind the shops, so that the cars can pull directly off the road, and yet not harm the shopping street.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Old shopping street - inconvenient f or cars and people.</p>
<p>Summary 4: To be convenient for traffic, and convenient for people walking, and connected to the fabric of the surrounding town, the shops must be arranged along a street, itself pedestrian, but opening off a major traffie artery, perhaps two, with parking behind, or underneath, to keep the cars from isolating the shops from surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The Stroget is the central shopping spine for the city; it is extremely long - almost a mile - and is entirely pedestrian, only cut periodically by roads which run at right angles to it.</p>
<p>Summary 6: ROADS; have as many shops as small as possible - INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS; where the shopping street crosses the road, make the crossing wide, giving priority to the pedestrians ROAD CROSSTNG; parking can easily be provided by a single row of parking spaces in an alley lying behind the shops all along the backs of the shops, off the alley, with the parking spaces walled, and perhaps even given canvas roofs, so that they don&#039;t destroy the area - SHIELDED PARKING, CANVAS ROOFS..</p>
