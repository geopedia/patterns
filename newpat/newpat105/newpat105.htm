<p>Summary 1:  Always place buildings to the north of the outdoor spaces that go with them, and keep the outdoor spaces to the south.</p>
<p>Summary 2: If the building is placed right, the building and its gardens wili be happy places full of activity and laughter.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The recently built Bank of America building in San Francisco - a giant building built by a major firm of architects - has its plaza on the north side.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In Eugene, Oregon, for example, with a rather rainy climate, at about 50&deg; latitude, the pattern is even more essential: the south faces of the buildings are the most valuable outdoor spaces on sunny days.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Make the outdoor spaces positive - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE - and break the building into narrow wings - WINGS OF LIGHT.</p>
<p>Summary 6: When the building is more developed, you can concentrate on the special sunny areas where the outdoors and building meet, and make definite places there, where people can sit in the sun -SUNNY PLACE.....</p>
