<p>Summary 1:  When determining exact location of windows also decide which windows should have low sills.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The &quot;Right&quot; height for a ground floor window sill is astonishingly low.</p>
<p>Summary 3: People are drawn to windows because of the light and the view outside - they are natural places to sit by when reading, talking, sewing, and so on, yet most windows have sill heights of 30 inches or so, so that when you sit down by them you cannot see the ground right near the window.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In &quot;The Function of Windows: A Reappraisal&quot; , Thomas Markus shows that the primary function of windows is not to provide light but to provide a link to the outside and that this link is most meaningful when it contains a view of the ground and the horizon.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Windows with high sills cut out the view of the ground.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If the sill is 12 to 14 inches high, you can comfortably see the ground, even if you are a foot or two away from the window, and it still feels like a window rather than a door..</p>
