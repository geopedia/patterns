<p>Summary 1:  Any homogeneous membrane which has holes in it will tend to rupture at the holes, unless the edges of the holes are reinforced by thickening.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Do not consider door and window frames as separate rigid structures which are inserted into holes in walls.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Think of them instead as thickenings of the very fabric of the wall itself, made to protect the wall against the concentrations of stress which develop around openings.</p>
<p>Summary 4: In line with this conception, build the frames as thickenings of the wall material, continuous with the wall itself, made of the same materials, and poured, or built up, in a manner which is continuous with the structure of the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Where the walls are made of wood planks and lightweight concrete fill - ess WALL MEMBRANES - the thickened frames can be made from the same wood planks, placed to form a bulge, and then filled to be continuous with the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In windows, splay the thickening, to create DEEP REVEALS; the form of doors and windows which will fill the frame, is given by the later patterns - WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE, SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS, SMALL PANES.....</p>
