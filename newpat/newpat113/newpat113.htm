<p>Summary 1:  Once you have the entrance of the building fixed and its transition clear - MAIN ENTRANCE, ENTRANCE TRANSITION - it is necessary to work out how a person can approach the building by car.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Place the parking place for the car and the main entrance, in such a relation to each other, that the shortest route from the parked car into the house, both to the kitchen and to the living rooms, is always through the main entrance.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Make the parking place for the car into an actual room which makes a positive and graceful place where the car stands, not just a gap in the terrain.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Since people always try to use the door nearest the car, the entrance nearest the parking spot always becomes the &quot;Main&quot; entrance, even if it was not planned that way.</p>
<p>Summary 5: For families with cars, the back door, being on the car side, dominates exit and entry, yet visitors are &quot;Supposed&quot; to come to the front door.</p>
<p>Summary 6: For some reason, even though the car is so important to the way of life in a modern house, the place where car and house meet is almost never treated seriously as a beautiful and significant place in its own right..</p>
