<p>Summary 1:  In any public space which depends for its success on its exposure to the street, open it up, with a fully opening wall which can be thrown wide open, and if it is possible, include some part of the activity on the far side of the pedestrian path, so that it actually straddles the path, and people walk through it as they walk along the path.</p>
<p>Summary 2: First, the obvious case: the wall along the street is made essentially of glass, and the view in is of some inviting activity.</p>
<p>Summary 3: By comparison, a wall which is actually open - with a sliding wall or shutter - creates a far more valuable and involving connection.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The most involving case of all: activity is not only open to sight and sound on one side of the path, but some part of the activity actually crosses the path, so that people who walk down the sidewalk find themselves walking through the activity.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A more modest version is the one where the roof of the space covers the path, the wall is entirely open, and the paving of the path is continuous with the &quot;Interior&quot; of the space.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Give the opening a boundary, when it is entirely open, with a low solid wall which people can sit on - SITTING WALL ; and make an outdoor room out of the part of the path which runs past it - PATH SHAPE, OUTDOOR ROOM.....</p>
