<p>Summary 1:  If we assume that the city contains major centers for every 300,000 people, spaced according to the rules in MAGIC OF THE CITY, it will then follow that the overall density of the city slopes off from these centers: the highest density near to them, the lowest far away.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Allow the high density to bulge in from the boundary, toward the center of gravity of the community, thus enlarging the eccentric nucleus toward the center.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Lee has shown that the phenomenon is not only caused by the fact that people are simply more familiar with the roads and paths that lie toward the center, and use them more often, but that their very perception of distance varies with direction, and that distances along lines toward the center are seen as much shorter than distances along lines away from the center.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Since we certainly want the community to correspond with the catch basin of its &quot;Center&quot; it is essential that the center be placed off-center in fact, at that point in the community which lies toward the center of the larger city.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Even though the center lies on one side of the community, forming a boundary of the community, we may also assume that the center does need to bulge into the community just a little.</p>
<p>Summary 6: If we make the boundary bulge toward the geometric center, then this axis will naturally form a center and, further, its catch basin, according to the data given above, will correspond almost perfectly with the community..</p>
