<p>Summary 1:  Paths along the building, short paths between buildings, PEDESTRIAN STREET, paths between CONNECTED BUILDINGS, and parts of CIRCULATION REALMS are all best as arcades.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Arcades - covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside - play a vital role in the way that people interact with buildings.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Wherever paths run along the edge of buildings, build arcades, and use the arcades, above all, to connect up the buildings to one another, so that a person can walk from place to place under the cover of the arcades.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If the major paths through and beside the buildings are genuinely public, covered by an extension of the building, a low arcade, with openings into the building - many doors and windows and half-open walls - then people are drawn into the building; the action is on display, they feel tangentially a part of it.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Arcades run along the building, where it meets the public world; they are open to the public, yet set partly into the building and at least seven feet deep.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The importance of these arcades which pass right through a building depends on the same functional effects as those described in BUILDING THOROUGHFARE..</p>
