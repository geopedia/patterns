<p>Summary 1:  Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a foot wide and splayed at about 50 to 60 degrees to the plane of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and the dark of the inner wall.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A window is always much brighter than an interior wall; and the walls tend to be darkest next to the window&#039;s edge.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The splayed reveal then creates a transition area - a zone of intermediate brightness - between the brightness of, the window and the darkness of the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In empirical studies of glare, Hopkinson and Petherbridge have found: that the larger the reveal is, the less glare there is; the reveal functions best, when its brightness is just halfway between the brightness of the window and the brightness of the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Build the depth of the frame so that it is continuous with the structure of the walls - FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES; if the wall is thin, make up the necessary depth for the reveal on the inside face of the wall, with bookshelves, closets or other THICK WALLS; embellish the edge of the window even further, to make light even softer, with lace work, tracery, and climbing plants - FILTERED LIGHT, HALF-INCH TRIM, CLIMBING PLANTS.....</p>
