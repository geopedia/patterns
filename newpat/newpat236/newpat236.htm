<p>Summary 1:  Many buildings nowadays have no opening windows at all; and many of the opening windows that people do build, don&#039;t do the job that opening windows ought to do.</p>
<p>Summary 2: It is becoming the rule in modern design to seal up windows and create &quot;Perfect&quot; indoor climates with mechanical air conditioning systems.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Double-hung windows cannot be fully opened - only half of the total window area can ever be opened at once.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Sliding windows have much, of the same problem - only part of the window area can be open, since one panel goes behind another; and they often get stuck too.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The old time French windows are a stunning example of this pattern.</p>
<p>Summary 6: They are narrow, full length upstairs windows, which swing out onto a tiny balcony, large enough only to contain the open windows..</p>
