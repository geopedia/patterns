<p>Summary 1:  Old people need old people, but they also need the young, and young people need contact with the old.</p>
<p>Summary 2: The young in other parts of town, have no chance of the benefit of older company, and the old people themselves are far too isolated.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The fact is that contemporary society shunts away old people; and the more shunted away they are, the deeper the rift between the old and young.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The segregation of the old causes the same rift inside each individual life: as old people pass into old age communities their ties with their own past become unacknowledged, lost, and there fore broken.</p>
<p>Summary 5: At the same time, they obviously need other old people around them; and some old people who are infirm need special services.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Treat the core like any group house; make all the cottages, both those close to and those further away, small - OLD AGE COTTAGE, some of them perhaps connected to the larger family houses in the neighborhood - THE FAMILY; provide every second or third core with proper nursing facilities; somewhere in the orbit of the old age pocket, provide the kind of work which old people can manage best - especially teaching and looking after tiny children - NETWORK OF LEARNING, CHILDREN&#039;S HOME, SETTLED WORK, VEGETABLE GARDEN .....</p>
