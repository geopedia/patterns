<p>Summary 1:  Place the load bearing elements - the columns and the walls and floors - according to the social spaces of the building; never modify the social spaces to conform to the engineering structure of the building.</p>
<p>Summary 2: What of the second kind of incongruence between social space and building form - the kind where the structure creates huge areas of almost uninterrupted &quot;Flexible&quot; space, punctuated by occasional columns, and the social spaces are created inside this framework by nonstructural partitions.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Since these spaces are so critical, it stands to reason that they must be felt as real spaces, not flimsily or haphazardly partitioned spaces, which only pay lip-service to the needs people experience.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Only when the most solid elements of the building form the spaces will the spaces be fully felt and the needs which call for the space then fully be satisfied.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Third: when the social space has, as its own surrounding, the fabric of the load-bearing structure which supports that space, then the forces of gravity are integrated with the social forces, and one feels the resolution of all the forces which are acting in this one space.</p>
<p>Summary 6: You will be able to guarantee that structure follows social spaces by placing columns at the corner of every social space - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS; and by building a distinct and separate vault over each room and social space - FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS..</p>
