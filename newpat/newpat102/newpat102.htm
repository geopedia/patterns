<p>Summary 1:  CIRCULATION REALMS portrayed a series of realms, in a large building or a building complex, with a major entrance or gateway into each realm and a collection of minor doorways, gates, and openings off each realm.</p>
<p>Summary 2: When a person arrives in a complex of offices, or services or workshops, or in a group of related houses, there is a good chance he will experience confusion unless the whole collection is laid out before him, so that he can see the entrance of the place where he is going.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In these cases we specified one clearly defined main entrance, with main reception clearly visible inside this main entrance and each &quot;Next&quot; point of reception then visible from the previous one, so that a patient who might be frightened or confused could find his way about by asking receptionists - and could always be directed to the next, visible receptionist down the line.</p>
<p>Summary 4: Within the indoor streets, the entrance to each service was made in a similar way - each one bulged out slightly into the street, so that people could easily find their way around among the resulting family of entrances.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A person who is looking for one of several entrances, and doesn&#039;t know his way around, needs to have some simple way of identifying the one entrance he wants.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In detail, make the entrances bold and easy to see - MAIN ENTRANCE ; when they lead into private domains, houses and the like, make a transition in between the, public street and the inside - ENTRANCE TRANSITION; and shape the entrance itself as a room, which straddles the wall, and is thus both inside and outside as a projecting volume, covered and protected from the rain and sun - ENTRANCE ROOM..</p>
