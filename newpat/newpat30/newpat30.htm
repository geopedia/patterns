<p>Summary 1:  To understand its action, imagine that a community and its boundary are growing under the influence of COMMUNITY OF 7000, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY, ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS, and DENSITY RINGS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Then modify the layout of the paths in the community to bring as many of them through these spots as possible.</p>
<p>Summary 3: One of the greatest problems in existing communities is the fact that the available public life in them is spread so thin that it has no impact on the community.</p>
<p>Summary 4: To create these concentrations of people in a community, facilities must be grouped densely round very small public squares which can function as nodes - with all pedestrian movement in the community organized to pass through these nodes.</p>
<p>Summary 5: First, each node must draw together the main paths in the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Summary 6: In any case the relationship between paths, community facilities, and squares is vital and hard to achieve..</p>
