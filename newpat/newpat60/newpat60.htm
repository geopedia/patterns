<p>Summary 1:  At the heart of neighborhoods, and near all work cominunities, there need to be small greens - IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, WORK COMMUNITY Of course it makes the most sense to locate these greens in such a way that they help form the boundaries and neighborhoods and backs - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY, QUIET BACKS.</p>
<p>Summary 2: People need green open places to go to; when they are close they use them.</p>
<p>Summary 3: If the greens are more than three minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need.</p>
<p>Summary 4: It is as if those people with ready access to a green display a full, free responsiveness to it; while people far away have lost their awareness of it and have suffered a reduced sensitivity to the pleasures of the green - for these people, the green has ceased to be a vital element in their neighborhood life.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The people who live more than three minutes walk from the green also need the relaxation, presumably.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Pay special attention to old trees, look after them - TREE PLACES; shape the green so that it forms one or more positive room-like spaces and surround it with trees, or walls, or buildings, but not roads or cars - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE, GARDEN WALL; and perhaps set aside some part of the green for special community functions - HOLY GROUND, GRAVE SITES, LOCAL SPORTS, ANIMALS, SLEEPING IN PUBLIC.....</p>
