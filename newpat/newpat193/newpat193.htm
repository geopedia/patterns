<p>Summary 1:  Wherever there are HALF-PRIVATE OFFICES, SIX-FOOT BALCONIES, ALCOVES, SITTING CIRCLES, BED ALCOVES, BUILDING THOROUGHFARES, ARCADES, or THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS, the spaces must be given a subtle balance of enclosure and openness by partly opening up the walls or keeping them half-open.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Adjust the walls, openings, and windows in each indoor space until you reach the right balance between open, flowing space and closed cell-like space.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Do not take it for granted that each space is a room; nor, on the other hand, that all spaces must flow into each other.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The kind of space which most easily supports both differentiation of activities and the transition between different activities has less enclosure than a solid room, and more enclosure - far more - than a space inside an open plan.</p>
<p>Summary 5: A wall which is half-open, half-enclosed - an arch, a trellised wall, a wall that is counter height with ornamented columns, a wall suggested by the reduction of the opening or the enlargemerit of the columns at the corners, a colonnade of columns in the wall - all these help get the balance of enclosure and openness right; and in these places people feel comfortable as a result.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Wherever a small space is in a larger space, yet slightly separate from it, make the wall between the two about half-open and half-solid - ALCOVES, WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE..</p>
