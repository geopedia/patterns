<p>Summary 1:  There is abundant evidence to show that high buildings make people crazy.</p>
<p>Summary 2: High buildings have no genuine advantages, except in speculative gains for banks and land owners.</p>
<p>Summary 3: The second, concerning offices and workplaces, we have placed in BUILDING COMPLEX, since it has implications not just for the height of buildings but also for their total volume.</p>
<p>Summary 4: At what height do the effects described by Fanning, Cappon, Morville, and Newman begin to take hold? It is our experience that in both housing and office buildings, the problems begin when buildings are more than four stories high.</p>
<p>Summary 5: Within the framework of the four-story limit the exact height of individual buildings, according to the area of floor they need, the area of the site, and the height of surrounding buildings, is given by the pattern NUMBER OF STORTES.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The horizontal subdivision of large buildings into smaller units, and separate smaller buildings, is given by BUlLDING COMPLEX..</p>
