<p>Summary 1:  According to COMMUNITY OF 7000, the political and economic life of the city breaks down into small, self-governing communities.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Local government of communities and local control by the inhabitants, will only happen if each community has its own physical town hall which forms the nucleus of its political activity.</p>
<p>Summary 3: To make the political control of local functions real, establish a small town hall for each community of 7000, and even for each neighborhood; locate it near the busiest intersection in the community.</p>
<p>Summary 4: We have argued, in MOSAlC OF SUBCUtTURES, COMMUNITY OF 7000, and IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, that every city needs to be made of self-governing groups, which exist at two different levels, the communities with populations of 5000 to 10,000 and the neighborhoods with populations of 200 to 1000.</p>
<p>Summary 5: When we translate the idea of community organization and community territory into physical terms, they yield two components: an arena and a zone of community projects.</p>
<p>Summary 6: The community needs a public forum, equipped with sound system, benches, walls to put up notices, where people are free to gather; a place which belongs to the community where people would naturally come whenever they think something should be done about something..</p>
